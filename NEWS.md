# dev

* read_bgm is now defunct

* fixed a gnarly bug due to lexicographic sorting on a list! Lines from faceSpatial were coming out in the sorted order of "face0", "face1", "face10", "face30" etc.

* renamed "leftbox" and "rightbox" to "left" and "right"

* readme includes all example files in bgmfiles

* new example files added

* added functions pointSpatial and nodeSpatial 

* new function bgmfile to replace deprecated read_bgm

* new tests and changes to capture Guam_utm1 variant
