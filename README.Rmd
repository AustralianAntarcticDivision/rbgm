## rbgm - R tools for Box Geometry model files

`rbgm` allows reading of geometry from BGM files, either in raw
coordinate form or as Spatial objects or sf objects. The aim is to make all of the following straightforward: 

* read of the BGM format, maintaining all topology and attributes
* use of the BGM specification for visualization and data extraction
* creation of BGM from shapefiles, R spatial objects and whatever else


## Installation

Install from CRAN: 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rbgm")
```

Install the development version from Github using `devtools`. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/rbgm")
```
