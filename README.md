## rbgm - R tools for Box Geometry model files

`rbgm` allows reading of geometry from BGM files, either in raw
coordinate form or as Spatial objects or sf objects. The aim is to make
all of the following straightforward:

-   read of the BGM format, maintaining all topology and attributes
-   use of the BGM specification for visualization and data extraction
-   creation of BGM from shapefiles, R spatial objects and whatever else

## Installation

Install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("rbgm")
```

Install the development version from Github using `devtools`.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/rbgm")
```
